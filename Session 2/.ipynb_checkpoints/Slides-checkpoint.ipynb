    "# What is Async Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Async programming is the concept of writing code that takes the function calls and replies to them later after processing, thus enabling I/O bound operations to be replied to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's note that async programming is single threaded so you can always assume that at a time only one operation is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### I/O Bound Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O Bound operations are the operations where the processing happnes outside of your current machine hence your machine is just idley sitting waiting for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python async programming\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import asyncio\n",
    "\n",
    "async def fn():\n",
    "    #do something\n",
    "\n",
    "async def run():\n",
    "    task = fn()\n",
    "    await fn()\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.run(run())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the above code and figure out what happens when task = fn() happens this doesn't mean that we called fn() and it's executing behind the scenes it just means that fn() was registered to be executed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (A)Wait a minute what does await do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does await actually tell the thread to start executing fn() and it just executes it ... Nope.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does await do? Await yields control back to an orchesterator that orchestrator looks through the registered functions and chooses which one to execute, but before going through that let's look at some examples."

    "A server socket is a network endpoint that listens for incoming connections from clients. It acts as a communication gateway, allowing multiple clients to establish connections and exchange data over a network.\n",

    "socket.accept() is a function that returns the client_socket and client_address that wants to connect to this server.\n",
